    "description": "*About Scrum*\n\nScrum is an iterative approach to Agile software development. The methodology has been around since the 1980s but was popularised by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber. \n\nScrum breaks the development of a product down in to discrete iterations (termed Sprints) that each deliver functionality that could potentially be shipped to users.\n\nThe Scrum Alliance offers an excellent [introduction to Scrum|http://www.scrumalliance.org/resources/47] that provides an overview of key Scrum concepts, stakeholders, processes and artefacts.",
